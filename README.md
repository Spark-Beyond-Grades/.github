# 🚀 Beyond Grades

**Tracking Growth Beyond Grades**

Beyond Grades is a student-first platform focused on understanding, enabling, and tracking growth that goes beyond academic scores.

We believe a student’s journey is shaped not just by grades, but by:
- participation
- exposure
- skills
- consistency
- real-world experiences

Beyond Grades is being built to capture and support this journey in a structured, meaningful way.
